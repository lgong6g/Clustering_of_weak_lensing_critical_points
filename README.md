# Clustering of weak lensing critical points
The statistics of critical points, both in 3D and 2D, have attracted significant interest due to their applications in cosmology. In 2D, the statistics of both peaks (maxima) and voids (minima) in weak gravitational lensing have been widely studied and applied to infer cosmological parameters using data from Stage-III surveys, including the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and the Hyper Suprime-Cam SSP Survey (HSC). These studies demonstrate that peaks and voids capture non-Gaussian information in the cosmological field. When combined with the weak lensing angular power spectrum, they significantly enhance parameter constraints compared to using the angular power spectrum alone. In particular for the parameter S8, several studies reported improvements in constraints of approximately 35% to 40%.
